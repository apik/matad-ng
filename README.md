MATAD-ng
====

**MATAD** is a form code for three-loop MAssive TADpole integral reduction originally written by M.Steinhauser and published in [Comput.Phys.Commun. 134 (2001) 335-364](http://inspirehep.net/record/532857).

**MATAD-ng** is based on the same code by M.Steinhauser but use FORM4 PolyRatFun for intermediate expressions and allow to produce reduction without expansion in ep in terms of master integrals and Euler gamma functions.
